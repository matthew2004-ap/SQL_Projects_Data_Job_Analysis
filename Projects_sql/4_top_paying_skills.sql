   /*Insight:

These reflect a blend of data engineering, ML/AI, and DevOps tools.

PySpark, Jupyter, and Pandas indicate value in big data and Python-based analytics.

GitLab, Bitbucket: High demand in environments with CI/CD workflows, suggesting overlap with data engineering or ML ops roles.

ðŸ”¬ Key Trends
1. Hybrid Skills Pay More
Skills like PySpark, Databricks, Airflow, and Kubernetes reflect crossover into data engineering and cloud infrastructure â€” these roles often command $125K+ salaries.

2. ML & AI Tools Command Premiums
Tools like DataRobot, Watson, Scikit-learn, and Jupyter show that ML-related skills are well-paid, especially when combined with data science or analytics.

3. Modern Version Control & Collaboration Tools
High salaries for Bitbucket, GitLab, and Atlassian tools highlight how data professionals who integrate into DevOps and team-based development environments are valued.

4. Cloud & Big Data Technologies
Tools like Databricks, GCP, AWS, Snowflake, BigQuery, and Hadoop show strong correlation with above-average salaries.

Suggests that cloud fluency is increasingly essential.

5. Programming Languages: Python > SQL > R
Python: $101K

SQL: $97K

R: $100K

Shows that Python leads, especially when paired with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn.

ðŸ’¼ Practical Takeaways for Data Analysts
Upskilling in PySpark, Databricks, or Airflow can be a path to a $130K+ role, especially in data engineering-heavy orgs.

Version control and collaboration tools (Git, GitLab, Bitbucket, JIRA) are increasingly essential.

Machine learning literacy (even basic familiarity with tools like Jupyter or Scikit-learn) boosts salary potential.

Cloud proficiency (esp. GCP, AWS, Azure) is becoming a baseline expectation.

ðŸ“‰ Lower Salary Tiers (<$90K)
Tools like Excel ($87K), PowerPoint, Outlook, Windows, and Visual Basic are associated with traditional business analysis and have limited earning ceiling unless complemented by more advanced tools
